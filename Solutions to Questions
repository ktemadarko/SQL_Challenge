1. How many users does Wave have?
Answer

-- I used the keyword DISTINCT so that I could get the number of distinct users
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u_id) AS total_users
FROM users;


2. How many transfers have been sent in the currency CFA?
Answer
--I used AS total_transfers to display the results in a titled column
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT transfer_id) AS total_transfers
FROM transfers
WHERE send_amount_currency='CFA';


3. How many different users have sent a transfer in CFA?
Answer
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u_id) AS users_CFA
FROM transfers
WHERE send_amount_currency='CFA';


4. How many agent_transactions did we have in the months of 2018 (broken down bymonth)?
Answer
--I am using Group by and Order by when_created
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month',when_created) AS month2018,
	COUNT(atx_id) AS total_ag_trans
	FROM agent_transactions
	WHERE when_created BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31 23:59:59'
	GROUP BY month2018
  	ORDER BY month2018 ASC;


5. Over the course of the last week, how many Wave agents were “net depositors” vs. “netwithdrawers”? 
Answer
SELECT agent_id,  
	SUM(amount) AS total_transaction_amount
	FROM public.agent_transactions
	WHERE when_created >= NOW() - interval '1 week'
	GROUP BY agent_id;  
-- The output of the above code should give a table showing columns agent_id and  total_transaction_amount
-- The agents with higher total_transaction_amount are more likely to be net depositors while  
-- The agents with lower total_transaction_amount are more likely to be net withdrawers
-- (I considered that some transcations would cancel out eg. deposit 100 cedis and withdraw 100 cedis)


6. Build an “atx volume city summary” table: find the volume of agent transactions created in the last week, grouped by city
Answer
CREATE TABLE atx volume city summary(
atx_volume_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
atx_id integer NOT NULL, 
agent_id integer NOT NULL,
country text
city text);

SELECT
city, when_created,
COUNT (DISTINCT atx_id) AS total_volume_of_transactions
FROM public.atx_volume_city_summary
WHERE when_created>= NOW() - interval '1 week'
GROUP BY city, when_created;
  -- The output of the above code should give a table showing columns city, when_created and  total_volume_of_transactions
  
  
  
 7. Now separate the atx volume by country as well (so your columns should be country,city, volume).
  Answer
  SELECT
    country,city, when_created,
    COUNT (DISTINCT atx_id) AS total_volume_of_transactions
    FROM public.atx_volume_city_summary
    WHERE when_created>= NOW() - interval '1 week'
    GROUP BY country, city, when_created;
  -- The output of the above code should give a table showing columns country, city, when_created and  total_volume_of_transactions
  
  
  8.Build a “send volume by country and kind” table: find the total volume of transfers (bysend_amount_scalar) 
  sent in the past week, grouped by country and transfer kind.
  Answer
  
  CREATE TABLE send_volume_by_country_kind
  (send_volume_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  atx_id integer NOT NULL, 
  agent_id integer NOT NULL,
  country text,
  transfer_kind text NOT NULL,
  send_amount_scalar numeric NOT NULL);
  
  SELECT country,transfer_kind, 
	COUNT(send_volume_id) AS total_volume_of_transactions
	FROM public.send_volume_by_country_kind
  	WHERE when_created>= NOW() - interval '1 week'
	GROUP BY country,transfer_kind;
  
  
  9. Then add columns for transaction count and number of unique senders (still brokendown by country and transfer kind)
  
  Answer
  SELECT country, transfer_kind, 
	COUNT(send_volume_id) AS total_volume_of_transactions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT u_id ) AS unique_senders
	FROM public.send_volume_by_country_kind
	WHERE when_created>= NOW() - interval '1 week' 
  --the where clause above is to get transactions for in the past week
	GROUP BY country, transfer_kind;
  
  
  10. Finally, which wallets have sent more than 10,000,000 CFA in transfers in the last month
  (as identified by the source_wallet_id column on the transfers table), and how much did they send?
  
  Answer
  SELECT source_wallet_id, 
  SUM(send_amount_scalar) as total_send_amount
  FROM transfers
  WHERE total_send_amount> 10,000,000 AND send_amount_currency='CFA';
